## Project setup
- I installed libraries such as vue chart js, bootstrap
- I set up my router folder and files 


### Challenges
- The biggest challenge I encountered is with some of the icons and the chart. 

### Solutions
- I installed font-awesome to install some icons
- I used vuechartjs for the chart but I was not able to properly set a fade blue background for each of the bars

### Improvements
- The font style can be better
- The side bar should be independently scrollable
- the  bars of the chart should have a background color and should be thiner

### conclusion
- I enjoyed working on this project and I learnt new things such as working on charts. Learning new things is a lifelong passion of mine.
